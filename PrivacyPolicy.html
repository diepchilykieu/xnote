    <h1>X-Notes - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 22, 2024</p>
    <p>X-Notes ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how
        we collect, use, and protect any information that you provide when using our mobile application ("App"). By
        using X-Notes, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>a. No Account Required</h3>
    <p>X-Notes does not require you to create an account or provide personal information in order to use the App.
        We
        do not collect names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h3>b. Non-Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect non-personal information automatically when you use the App, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)</li>
        <li>Usage data (e.g., in-app activity, game statistics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve and optimize the performance of the App.</li>
        <li>Monitor usage patterns to help us improve the game experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal information is used for marketing purposes or shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>X-Notes may use third-party services (e.g., analytics tools) to help us analyze the app’s performance.
        These
        third parties may collect anonymous usage data, but no personal information is shared or collected.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. X-Notes uses commercially reasonable safeguards to
        protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the
        internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>X-Notes does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the app does not require
        account
        creation, no personal data is requested. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information
        from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the App, and the "Last
        Updated" date at the top of this page will be revised. Your continued use of the App after changes are made
        constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
